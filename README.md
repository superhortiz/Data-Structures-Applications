# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains various projects and simulations to practice and understand the implementation of different data structures and algorithms. Each project is organized into its own directory and focuses on a specific algorithm or data structure.

## Projects and Descriptions

### 8_puzzle
An implementation of the classic 8-puzzle problem. Includes modules for the board, solver, and main puzzle logic. It was implemented using the A* algorithm and a priority queue.

### convex_hull
Algorithms to compute the convex hull of a set of points. It was implemented using a sorting algorithm.

### event_driven_simulations
Simulations for various physical processes including billiards, Brownian motion, diffusion, and random processes. It was implemented using a priority queue.

### flocking_boids
Simulation of flocking behavior using Boid algorithms. It was implemented using KD Trees.

### interval_search
Implementation of interval search trees for efficient interval management and queries. It was implemented using a Red-Black Binary Search Tree.

### n_body_simulation
Simulations for the N-body problem, which models the motion of particles under mutual gravitational influence. It was implemented using KD Trees.

### orthogonal_line_segment_intersection
Algorithms to detect intersections between orthogonal line segments using sweep line techniques. It was implemented using a Red-Black BST and a priority queue.

### orthogonal_rectangle_intersection
Algorithms to detect intersections between orthogonal rectangles using sweep line techniques and rectangle search trees. It was implemented using a Rectangle Search Tree and a priority queue. The Rectangle Search Tree was implemented as a class that inherits the behavior of the Red-Black BST class to guarantee a balanced tree.

### percolation
Simulation and analysis of percolation problems. Includes solvers and statistical analysis modules. It was implemented using the Union-Find data structure.

### utils
Utility classes and functions used across different projects, including geometric primitives, data structures like Red-Black Binary Search Trees, and Union-Find algorithms.

### verlet_integration
Simulations using Verlet integration for physics-based motion. It was implemented using KD Trees.
